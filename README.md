ensemble model training on lung cancer dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajeetdas/iq-othnccd-lung-cancer-dataset-augmented) using two models: densenet from TorchXRayVision trained specifically on X-Ray images, and vision transformer model from MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI). The resnet model scores 95-97% and the ViT model scores 90-92% on test datasets; combined ensemble model gives an accuracy around 96%.
